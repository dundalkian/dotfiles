# Yeah lmao you have to do this yourself I'm not going to let this script
# wipe a drive by accident.


##Select the mirrors##

# This section is commented out because while a decent solution, the modern
# archiso will run reflector in the background and auto-update the mirrorlist
# relatively decently. If there is ever a change to that, this can be readded.


# Save a backup of the mirrorlist just in case
#cp /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist.backup

# Pull all up to date mirrors from the US. Uncomments that list,
# tests speeds for all and outputs top 10 to a new mirrorlist,
# which should be copied over by pacstrap
#curl -s "https://www.archlinux.org/mirrorlist/?country=US&use_mirror_status=on" | sed -e 's/^#Server/Server/' -e '/^#/d' | rankmirrors -n 10 - > /etc/pacman.d/mirrorlist

# You'll have to pacman -Sy and pacman -S git

##Install essential packages##

# Before pacstrap is run, we need to make sure our mirrorlist has been sorted, as this mirrorlist will be
# copied into the new system
